MUST NOTE:
- do not use pretrained model (Used adversarial images) 
- need gumamit ng AI algorithms (Faster R-CNN)
- get the metrics, accuracy, then visualize using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- create gui
- used mvc

TO ADD:
- filter violence
- mAP, F1 score, accuracy
- login, newsfeed, account ui (optional)

PRESENTATION:
- how you make it together with the system
- what is the result
- recommendation 
- walkthrough to the first module to the last module

COMMANDS:
- python -m venv venv
- venv\scripts\activate
- python -r requirements.txt

FILES:
- __init__.py: initializing blueprints
- routes.py: intended for routes (moving between pages)
- main.py: entry point of the Program
- requirements.txt: required modules for flask to work

FOLDERS:
- static: includes images, css, javascript
- pages: pages that users can see
- auth: authentication
cccccccccc
FOR TESTING AND VALIDATION
- google colab removes files after run time is finish, make sure to reupload the epoch 5 to avoid re-running the training section
- run load dataset section
- upload _annotations.coco.json files inside every folder of the dataset segmentation
- run validation/ testing part
